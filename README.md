# ISLR-Exercises

This repository contains my solutions to the end-of-chapter exercises from *An Introduction to Statistical Learning* (ISLR) by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, and Robert Tibshirani. I’m using Quarto (`.qmd`) to document my work in R, blending code, analysis, and insights as I progress through the book. This is an ongoing project, and I’ll be adding solutions chapter by chapter during my studies.


## Chapters completed

## Notes

 Follow my journey as I tackle ISLR, one chapter at a time. Happy learning!
